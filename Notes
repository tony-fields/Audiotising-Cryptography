This is a notes document for me, explaining my rationale of what I am programming

I wrote my C code without thinking of how to implement the cryptography algorithms.
Big mistake as I doubt I could implement those algorithms realtively easily.
However, I can package what I have been working on in a Python package and let 
python encrypt my data


Currently I have a header file that works and methods that can seperate data
The methods I want to make:

string split(string WavName):
        returns name of both headerfile.bin and content.bin

void combine(string newFileName, string headerfile.bin, string content.bin)
// write a new file with newFileName with the provided header and content
